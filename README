COMPILATION

A simple "./configure && make && make install" should suffice.  You
may need to install any development packages for libgtk.

RUNNING

Run with "./rftg".  You may specify number of players, expansion level,
etc with some command line options:

	-p <num>       -- Number of players (including yourself)
	-a             -- Play a two-player advanced game
	-e <expansion> -- Expansion level to play:
				0: Base game only
				1: The Gathering Storm
				2: Rebel vs Imperium

You may also change these setting once the game is running with the
"Select Parameters" option under the Game menu.

INTERFACE

Cards in your hand are displayed across the bottom of the window.  Your
active cards are just above, in the blue-shaded area.  Your opponents
active cards will be displayed in the top colored areas.

You may move your pointer over any card to see a full-sized version in
the upper-left.

In between your hand and active area is a prompt asking for your next
play.  Typically this is a request to choose a role, choose a card to
play or cards to discard, etc.  Select a role (or two roles if playing
the two-player advanced game) by using the drop-down box.  Select cards
to play or discard by clicking on them in your hand area.  When you
are satisfied, click the "Ok" button at the far right of the prompt
area.  This button will not be clickable if your current selection is
not legal.
